	The core strategy that our bot implements is to find the closest bunny of the ones available, then pick it up and continue searching for bunnies. In addition to this, there are many scenarios that the bot will react to in order to advance its or score or detract from its opponent's score. The first of which is that if the bot will deposit all bunnies that it is carrying once it collects 7 bunnies so as not to go over the weight limit.
	In order to sabotage the opponent's playpen, the bot will check if it is within a certain euclidean distance to the enemy playpen, and it so it will go open it. Once this occurs, the bot will log the time it occurred at and wait 200,000 cycles before checking if it's within the allowed distance to sabotage, thus ensuring the bot does not spend too much time sabotaging and not enough time collecting. The bot also has a safety mechanism in that if the friendly playpen is opened, the bot will immediately go close it before returning to catching bunnies.
	The last optimization that we implemented was the request carrot portion, which is called if the bot has less than 10 carrots. This interrupt will set a flag to true, at which point the puzzle will be evaluated.
